# K Closest Points to Origin

## Problem Description

Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k, return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).

The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., âˆš(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2).

You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).

## Explanation

This solution uses a max heap (priority queue) to efficiently find the K closest points to the origin.

### How It Works (Step-by-Step):

Consider the points: [[1,3],[-2,2]] and k = 1

1. Initialize a max heap.

2. Iterate through the points:
   - For [1,3]: Calculate distance 1^2 + 3^2 = 10. Add to heap.
   - For [-2,2]: Calculate distance (-2)^2 + 2^2 = 8. Add to heap, then remove farthest point.

3. The heap now contains the K closest points.

4. Return these points as the result.

## Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: O(n log k), where n is the number of points. We iterate through all n points, and each heap operation takes O(log k) time.
- Space Complexity: O(k) to store the k closest points in the heap.
